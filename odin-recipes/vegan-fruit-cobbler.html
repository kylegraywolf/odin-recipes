        <h2>Vegan Fruit Cobbler</h2>
        
        <p>
            Cobbler is a dessert usually consisting of a fruit filling poured 
            into a baking dish an covered with a batter, biscuit, or dumpling
            before being baked. Some cobbler recipes, notably in the American South, 
            resemble a thick-crusted, deep dish pie with both a top and bottom crust.
